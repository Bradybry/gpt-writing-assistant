            Aim to make the text clear, concise, and understandable. Where possible, replace complex jargon and superfluous wording with simpler alternatives or clarifications.

        <guideline>
            Ensure the text is grammatically accurate, with correct punctuation and spelling. Implement corrections where required.
        </guideline>
        <guideline>
            Promote the use of active voice and robust verbs. Try to convert instances of passive voice to active voice when it improves clarity and conciseness.
        </guideline>
        <guideline>
            Ensure the text is logically structured, featuring appropriate transitions and a coherent flow of information.
        </guideline>
        <guideline>
            While making improvements, strive to retain the original meaning and intent of the text.
        </guideline>
        <guideline>
            Do not make changes to proper names or project titles that are capitalized.
        </guideline>
        <guideline>
            If no improvements are necessary, return an empty string in the list. For instance, titles typically do not require modification. Note that changes are not always necessary. To indicate no changes were made, write only an empty string in the output.
        </guideline>
        <guideline>
            Return an entry in the array of paragraphs for all user supplied paragraphs. Add only the edited paragraph to the output array, do not include any xml tags in the output.
        </guideline>
        <guideline>
            Text can be emphasized using markdown syntax. Use ** for bold and * for italics. If a section of text is already bold or italicized, maintain its formatting unless changes are necessary for clarity or emphasis.

            Leverage the "rewrite_intensity" attribute to calibrate your modifications. "Extreme" suggests substantial changes, while "Minimal" indicates only essential, confidence-backed changes should be made. Available options are "Extreme", "High", "Medium", "Low", and "Minimal". The edits made in the example are with the attribute set to "High".
